*Modelling and management of Experiences, Knowledge and Competences for 
Manufacturing Systems *
*Eric Bonjour* (eric.bonjour@univ-lorraine.fr), *Laurent Geneste* 
(laurent.geneste@enit.fr), *Bertrand Rose* (bertrand.rose@unistra.fr).

For many industrial companies, preserving, developing and managing their 
immaterial assets are key issues. These immaterial assets are mainly 
composed of: experiences (contextualized knowledge, knowledge in 
action), general knowledge (tacit or explicit, individual or collective) 
and competences. Manufacturing systems are often socio-technical systems 
in which human actors still play major roles, especially in cognitive 
intensive tasks (such as problem solving or diagnosis). Taking into 
account this human oriented aspect of manufacturing systems requires 
dedicated approaches. The objective of this special session is to 
present and discuss novel approaches (models, methodologies) for the 
modelling, the control and the management of immaterial assets in the 
context of manufacturing systems. The mains topics for this session are 
(but are not restricted to):
knowledge engineering for industrial companies
formalization and methodologies of experience feedback and lesson learning
formalization and methodologies of competence systems
integration of experience/knowledge/competence management in operational 
management (planning, scheduling, simulation for instance)
information systems to support experience/knowledge/competence access
collaborative practices supported by experience/knowledge/competence
link between experience/knowledge/competence management and industrial 
performance
social dimension of experience/knowledge/competence management

/*Key Words: * Knowledge management in production; Enterprise modelling, 
integration and networking; Supply chains and networks /
