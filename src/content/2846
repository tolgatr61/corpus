The University of Namur is recruiting a full-time lecturer in the
Faculty of Computer Science (http://www.unamur.be/info).

Job description
===============

The Faculty of Computer Science provides cutting-edge teaching and
research, with a view to putting computers at the service of society,
taking account of their impact on the environment and respectful of
the values of solidarity and sustainable development. This fits within
a broad, holistic and inter-disciplinary vision of computer science.

The specific orientation of the successful candidate shall reflect the
broad and interdisciplinary vision of the Faculty and shall contribute
to its global mission by targeting, for example, subjects such as
large scale and distributed computing, software engineering and
artificial intelligence. This orientation shall have at least a
potential opening towards current fields of application in society,
such as energy and sustainable development, healthcare, ageing,
mobility, or intelligent objects (see EU themes). In addition, other
areas of competence and application may also be taken into
consideration, with qualifications being as important as the field of
specialisation.

The successful candidate shall be responsible for teaching on the
Bachelors and Masters courses, for day-time and adult evening
classes. They shall also supervise end-of-study theses. They shall use
dynamic and stimulating teaching methods, following the innovative
institutional teaching policy (PUNCH).  The successful candidate shall
conduct research at international level in areas of computer science
likely to lead to cooperation with other academic staff in the
Faculty. They shall supervise doctoral theses. Through their research
activities, they will contribute to the international visibility of
the University. The specific orientation of the candidate shall
reflect the broad interdisciplinary vision of the Faculty.

Finally, they will end up providing service activities within the
Faculty and/or the University.

The Faculty will be particularly favourable to those candidates who
show a capacity for openness, integration, evolution and for adapting
both at thematic and at personal level.

Qualifications required
=======================

The successful candidate shall:

- hold a doctorate in computer science or equivalent (the certificate
   to be awarded in the near future where appropriate);

- show experience and/or teaching skills suitable for a university
   audience;

- show the existence of scientific experience recognised by
   publications at international level;

- master both spoken and written French in order to give lectures
   immediately within the remit and which shall be given in French.

The following aspects shall be considered as attributes:

- experience in university teaching and a particular aptitude for
   dynamic and stimulating teaching methods.

- an academic posting of considerable duration in an institution other
   than where the thesis was written;

- a capacity for working in a team and for integrating research
   results into teaching ;

- creativeness and an awareness of teaching innovation and
   interdisciplinarity ;

- a capacity for animating or even leading a team of researchers;

- mastering both spoken and written English or a commitment to acquire
   such during the year following the taking up of the position, with
   the knowledge of other languages representing an additional
   advantage.

Contract
========

Entry into service is expected to be 1 June 2018. The Management Board
provides for a period of integration of two years if it is the first
time that the candidate is appointed to the academic staff of the
University of Namur. At the end of this period the candidate should be
officially appointed in his post. The salary proposed is in accordance
with the rate applied by all the universities in the Wallonia-Brussels
Federation. (https://www.unamur.be/universite/jobs/baremes).

Applications & additional information

Environment
===========

The University of Namur, with around 60 university courses in first,
second and tertiary cycles and its 64 laboratories and research
centres hosts nearly 7000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and
has over 1200 staff members, including nearly one thousand
researchers. Within the University of Namur the Faculty of Computer
Science has over 400 students on daytime and evening/Saturday
timetable, 80 members of staff including 18 professors and around 50
researchers. Founded in 1968, the Faculty of Computer Science has
trained over 1,800 high-level computer science graduates since then.

The Faculty of Computer Science provides cutting-edge teaching and
research, with a view to putting computers at the service of society,
taking account of their impact on the environment and respectful of
the values of solidarity and sustainable development. The Faculty is a
founder member of the Namur Digital Institute (NADI) which groups
together over 150 researchers in the field of digital technology.

Research in the Faculty is focused on information and communications
systems. The Faculty contributes to the development of such systems
through different aspects of engineering (information engineering,
software engineering, networks) and basic aspects (models, languages
and methods). It has a multi-disciplinary approach and addresses in
particular the issues and challenges of computer science in
organisations and in society. The Faculty has therefore developed
strong research synergies with other disciplines such as law,
management, sociology and ethics.

Capital of Wallonia, Namur is a highly convivial town with 100,000
inhabitants located 50 km south of Brussels, at 2h50 from Paris and
3h30 from London.
