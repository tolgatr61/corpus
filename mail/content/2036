Cher(e)s collègues,

Comme vous le savez, la 7ème édition de la conférence internationale 
Research Challenges in Information Systems (RCIS) aura lieu du 29 au 31 
mai 2013 à Paris, en Sorbonne, en même temps et sur le même site que le 
31ème Congrès INFORSID.

Suite à de nombreuses demandes, nous avons reporté *la date limite de 
soumission des "full papers" de RCIS au 1er février.*

Aucun changement n'est à signaler pour les papiers de type poster (2 
pages), demos (2 pages) et doctoral consortium (6 pages) qui sont 
attendus jusqu'au 15 février.

Je vous invite aussi à proposer des tutoriaux dans vos domaines 
respectifs de prédilection jusqu'au 15 février.

L'appel à communication pour les "full papers" (12 pages) est repris 
ci-dessous. Les appels spécifiques des autres types de soumission sont 
disponibles à cette URL: http://rcis-conf.com/

Au plaisir de vous rencontrer fin mai.

Bien cordialement,
Selmin Nurcan
RCIS'2013 PC Co-Chair

RCIS 2013 is a conference of RCIS Conference Series and is sponsored by 
IEEE France section. This year, RCIS will be co-located with the 31st 
French Conference on Information Systems (INFORSID 2013), a prominent 
French scientific event sharing with RCIS the interest on the field of 
Information Science.



SCOPE AND TOPICS
--------------------------
The Seventh International Conference on RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN 
INFORMATION SCIENCE aims at providing an international forum for 
scientists, researchers, engineers and developers from a wide range of 
information science areas to exchange ideas and approaches in this 
evolving field. While presenting research findings and state-of-art 
solutions, you are especially invited to share experiences on new 
research challenges in these main topics:

     - Information System Engineering
     - Requirements Engineering
     - Database and Information System Integration
     - Data Management
     - Information Search and Discovery
     - Software Testing
     - Human-Computer Interaction
     - Web Information Systems
     - Grid Computing and Cloud Computing
     - Social Computing
     - User Centred Approaches
     - Decision Information Systems
     - Knowledge Management
     - Knowledge Discovery from Data
     - Business Process Analysis, Modelling and Design
     - Business Applications
     - Information Security Risk
     - Information and Value Management

Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although 
authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related topics are 
also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the conference main topics.


CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS AND BEST PAPERS
----------------------------------------------------
Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for 
other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication at 
RCIS 2013. Authors are invited to submit papers in English. Each 
submitted paper will have to be associated to one of the four following 
categories.

- Technical solution papers present solutions that are novel or 
significantly improve existing solutions. A technical solution paper 
must include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution. Results 
must be stated clearly enough so that it is possible to validate them in 
later research (12 pages).
- Evaluation papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate 
proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e. by empirical studies, 
experiments, case studies, simulations, mathematical proofs, etc. The 
research method must be sound and appropriate (12 pages).
- Industrial practice and experience papers present problems or 
challenges encountered in practice, relate success and failure stories, 
or report on industrial practice. The practice must be clearly described 
and its context must be given (12 pages).
- Doctoral Papers are papers submitted by doctoral students only and are 
related to research work in progress (6 pages).
- Poster papers as well as Demo papers aim to gather researchers in a 
forum to showcase their work and obtain feedback on on-going research 
from knowledgeable conference attendees (2 pages).

The submission site address 
ishttps://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcis2013

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one of 
them will register to the conference and present the paper. Only papers 
that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be 
published in IEEE Proceedings.

Authors of papers that obtain the highest marks in the reviewing process 
will be invited to submit an extended version to a special issue of the 
International Journal of Information System Modeling and Design (IGI), 
to appear at the end of 2014 (vol. 5 issue 4).

Since Proceedings will be published with the IEEE Conference 
Publications Program through IEEE Xplore digital library, paper 
submissions must be formatted using the IEEE 2-column format (see 
Conference Templates,
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 

They should be limited to a maximum of 12 pages and be submitted in PDF 
format. Please use the IEEE PDF eXpress tool 
(http://www.pdf-express.org/) to convert your source file into IEEE 
Xplore compliant PDF File or to check if your own PDF file is IEEE 
Xplore compliant. IEEE PDF eXpress is a free service to IEEE 
conferences, allowing their authors to make IEEE Xplore-compatible PDFs 
(Conversion function) or to check PDFs that authors have made themselves 
for IEEE Xplore compatibility (PDF Check function). The conference ID 
for IEEE PDF eXpress tool will be provided soon on the RCIS 2013 web 
site. It is important to note that submitting a file to IEEE PDF eXpress 
is only for creation of a compliant PDF file, you must still submit your 
final paper through online submission.
